# Installation note on GEOtop 

GEOtop (Endrizzi et al, 2014 and references therein) is a distributed model of the mass and energy balance of the hydrological cycle. GEOtop is applicable to simulations in continuum in small or relatively large montain catchments. GEOtop deals with the effects of topography on the interaction between energy balance and hydrological cycle (water, glacier and snow) with peculiar solutions. The source code of GEOtop 2.0 with detailed documentation is available for researchers and environmental/software engineers through the following links:

https://code.google.com/p/geotop/
https://github.com/se27xx/GEOtop/
https://github.com/skyglobe/geotop



For  Unix-like OS users, a C source code can be rapidly downloaded and built with the following instrunctions (https://github.com/se27xx/GEOtop/):


1) Open a console and go to the drectory where to clone GEOtop source code;
3) Clone the source code typing: "git clone https://github.com/se27xx/GEOtop";
2) Enter GEOtop directory typing: "cd GEOtop";
3) Create the subdirectory for the executable file  "mkdir bin";
4) Build and create GEOtop executale file: "make -f geotop.make"

GEOtop executable will be created in the subdirectory "bin".
